# Data Science Projects Repository

This Git repository is a collection of data science projects that I have completed. Each project is organized to emulate a proper data science structure, consisting of the following directories:

- **src**: Includes source code files with the core logic and findings of the projects.
- **scripts**: Contains scripts that could be imported in the source code files. They are used to help with the core logic of the respective project.
- **README**: Provides an overview and instructions for each project.

In the **scripts** folder, you will find well-structured scripts that define functions to perform various tasks related to data processing. The use of `argparse` allows for flexible command-line execution, making it easy to run the scripts with different parameters.

Feel free to explore the repository and the individual projects!
